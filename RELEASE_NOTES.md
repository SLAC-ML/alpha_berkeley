# Alpha Berkeley Framework - Latest Release (v0.4.4)

ðŸ”§ **Code refactoring and API improvements** - consolidated example formatting system with unified interface and reduced code duplication.

## What's New

### ðŸ”§ Code Refactoring and API Improvements
- **Unified Example Formatting**: Consolidated example formatting with new `BaseExample.join()` static method
- **Code Deduplication**: Removed duplicate formatting methods from subclasses, reducing codebase by 23+ lines
- **Flexible Formatting Options**: Added support for separators, numbering, randomization, and example limits
- **Bias Prevention**: Maintained randomization for classifier examples to prevent positional bias in few-shot learning
- **API Consistency**: Unified formatting interface across all example types for better maintainability

### ðŸŽ¯ Developer Experience
- **Cleaner Codebase**: Eliminated duplicate `format_examples_for_prompt()` methods across example subclasses
- **Better Maintainability**: Centralized formatting logic reduces maintenance burden for future example types
- **Consistent Interface**: All example formatting now uses the same unified API with flexible options

## Upgrade Notes

This is a patch release with code refactoring and API improvements:

- **API Changes**: Deprecated `format_examples_for_prompt()` methods - use `BaseExample.join()` instead
- **Backwards Compatibility**: All existing functionality is preserved with the new unified interface
- **Performance**: Slight performance improvement due to reduced code duplication
- **Maintainability**: Future example types will benefit from the unified formatting system
