# Alpha Berkeley Framework - Latest Release (v0.4.0)

üöÄ **Major feature release with critical bug fixes** - a comprehensive update to the Alpha Berkeley Framework.

## What's New

### üéØ Major New Features
- **Context Memory Optimization**: Intelligent data summarization with `recursively_summarize_data()` to prevent context window overflow
- **Configurable Python Executor**: Complete configuration system with `PythonExecutorConfig` for centralized timeout and retry settings
- **Enhanced Figure Registration**: Batch figure registration support for improved performance
- **OpenWebUI Performance**: Response chunking for large outputs and static URL serving for figures

### üêõ Critical Bug Fixes
- **Infinite Loop Fix**: Resolved critical infinite reclassification loop that occurred when orchestrator hallucinated non-existent capabilities
- **Limit Enforcement**: Router now properly enforces `max_reclassifications` limit across all reclassification paths
- **Dependency Issues**: Fixed OpenTelemetry version constraints and compatibility issues

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Improvements
- **Unified Error System**: Consolidated dual reclassification paths into single, consistent error-based approach
- **Exception-Based Design**: Infrastructure nodes now use proper `ReclassificationRequiredError` exceptions
- **Context Method Refactoring**: Renamed `get_human_summary()` to `get_summary()` with backwards compatibility
- **State Cleanup**: Removed obsolete `control_needs_reclassification` field for cleaner state management

### ‚ö° Performance & Usability
- **Python Executor Enhancements**: Configurable timeouts, better error handling, improved figure collection
- **Context Window Management**: Automatic truncation of large results to manage LLM context limits
- **Enhanced Error Classification**: Better distinction between retriable and configuration errors

## Upgrade Notes

This is a major release with significant new features and critical bug fixes:

- **Critical Bug Fix**: Resolves infinite loop during task classification
- **New Configuration**: Python executor now supports configurable timeouts and retry limits
- **API Changes**: Context classes now use `get_summary()` instead of `get_human_summary()` (backwards compatible)
- **Performance**: Improved memory usage and response times for large outputs
- **Backwards Compatibility**: All changes maintain backwards compatibility with deprecation warnings
