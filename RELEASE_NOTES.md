# Alpha Berkeley Framework - Latest Release (v0.2.1)

ðŸ”§ **Major stability and usability improvements** for the Alpha Berkeley Framework!

## What's Fixed

### Critical Issues Resolved
- **Containerized Python Execution**: Fixed critical bug where execution metadata wasn't being created in mounted volumes
- **Container Build Failures**: Removed obsolete python3-epics-simulation kernel mounts that caused build failures
- **Path Mapping**: Fixed hardcoded path patterns in container execution using config-driven approach

### Security & Stability Improvements
- **Repository Security**: Updated .gitignore to exclude development services and sensitive configurations
- **Network Security**: Renamed container network from als-agents-network to alpha-berkeley-network for consistency
- **Service Cleanup**: Removed mem0 service references and cleaned up leftover container code

### Developer Experience Enhancements
- **Configuration System Refactoring**: Renamed `unified_config` module to `config` for improved developer experience
- **Professional Naming**: Replaced `UnifiedConfigBuilder` with `ConfigBuilder` to eliminate confusing terminology
- **Automatic Environment Detection**: Added container-aware Python environment detection for convenience
- **Graceful Ollama Fallback**: Implemented automatic URL fallback for development workflows

## Upgrade Notes

This release maintains full backward compatibility. The main changes are:
- Import paths updated from `unified_config` to `config` (automatic detection handles this)
- Container execution is more reliable and requires no manual reconfiguration
- Timezone handling is now consistent across all services
