# Alpha Berkeley Framework - Latest Release (v0.3.0)

üöÄ **Major interface enhancements and figure display improvements** for the Alpha Berkeley Framework!

## What's New

### üñ•Ô∏è Interface Context System
- **Multi-Interface Support**: Runtime detection for CLI, OpenWebUI, and other interfaces
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Interface-specific behavior and response customization
- **Smart Figure Handling**: Different figure display strategies based on interface capabilities

### üìä Centralized Figure Registry
- **Capability-Agnostic Registration**: Universal figure registration system for all execution types
- **Rich Metadata**: Figure source, timestamps, and execution context tracking
- **Automatic Display**: Seamless integration with OpenWebUI for base64 figure rendering

### üîß Enhanced Python Executor
- **Robust Serialization**: Comprehensive JSON serialization for scientific objects (matplotlib, numpy, pandas)
- **Error Recovery**: Enhanced error handling with detailed reporting and fallback mechanisms
- **Path Resolution**: Smart figure path resolution for different execution environments

### üìù Real-Time Log Viewer
- **OpenWebUI Integration**: `/logs` command for viewing application logs in chat
- **In-Memory Capture**: Live log streaming with configurable buffer size
- **Debug Support**: Real-time monitoring and troubleshooting through chat interface

### üèóÔ∏è Framework Enhancements
- **State Management**: Centralized figure registry with capability source tracking
- **Configuration System**: Added `get_interface_context()` for runtime interface detection
- **Response Generation**: Interface-aware prompts and context-sensitive responses
- **UI Integration**: Enhanced figure display with metadata and creation timestamps
