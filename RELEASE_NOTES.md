# Alpha Berkeley Framework - Latest Release (v0.6.0)

‚ö° **Performance Optimization Release** - Configurable bypass modes for task extraction and capability selection enabling flexible performance tuning.

## What's New

### ‚ö° Performance Optimization System
- **Task Extraction Bypass**: Skip LLM-based task extraction and use full conversation context directly in downstream processing
- **Capability Selection Bypass**: Skip LLM-based classification and activate all registered capabilities automatically
- **Runtime Control**: New slash commands (`/task:off`, `/task:on`, `/caps:off`, `/caps:on`) for dynamic performance adjustment during conversations
- **Configuration Support**: System-wide defaults via `agent_control` section in config.yml

### üéØ When to Use Bypass Modes
- **Task Bypass**: Code R&D scenarios, short conversations, minimal external data, high-throughput applications
- **Capability Bypass**: Exploratory R&D, small capability registries, uncertain capability requirements
- **Performance Trade-offs**: Faster upstream pipeline (1-2 fewer LLM calls) vs. longer orchestrator processing

### üìö Documentation Enhancements
- Comprehensive bypass mode documentation with real CLI session examples
- Performance comparison tables showing LLM call reduction
- Use case guidance and trade-off analysis
- Cross-referenced documentation across gateway, task extraction, and classification

### üîß Bug Fix
- **Data Source Request Creation**: Fixed user_id extraction to properly use session info instead of accessing non-existent state field

## Previous Release (v0.5.0)

### üî¨ ALS Assistant Application
- **Complete Scientific Application**: First fully-featured domain-specific application for accelerator physics operations at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory's Advanced Light Source
- **PV Finder Service**: Intelligent EPICS process variable discovery using natural language queries with MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration
- **Application Launcher**: Desktop integration service with MCP protocol support for seamless tool launching
- **Comprehensive Knowledge Base**: 11,000+ process variables, accelerator objects database, and MATLAB codebase analysis

### üß† Advanced Capabilities
- **Data Analysis**: 7 specialized capability modules for accelerator physics operations including live monitoring, machine operations, and archiver data access
- **Data Visualization**: Advanced plotting and analysis tools specifically designed for accelerator operations
- **Machine Operations**: Direct control and monitoring capabilities for accelerator systems
- **Historical Data Access**: Integration with ALS archiver systems for historical analysis

### üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure & Services
- **MongoDB Integration**: Database service with Docker containerization for data persistence
- **Langfuse Observability**: Enhanced monitoring and tracing with containerized Langfuse deployment
- **Container Orchestration**: Specialized Docker services for PV finder, database, and observability
- **Benchmarking Suite**: Performance analysis tools and model comparison frameworks

## Upgrade Notes

This is a **major feature release** introducing the first complete domain-specific application:

- **New Application Structure**: ALS Assistant application added under `src/applications/als_assistant/`
- **New Services**: MongoDB, Langfuse, and PV Finder services with Docker containerization
- **Enhanced Dependencies**: Added MCP protocol support, enhanced container execution capabilities
- **Backwards Compatibility**: All existing framework functionality is preserved and enhanced
- **Documentation**: Complete RST documentation with setup guides and architectural diagrams
