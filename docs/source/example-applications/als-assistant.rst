ALS Accelerator Assistant
=========================

.. admonition:: Research Publication
   :class: note

   This system is described in detail in the research paper `"Agentic AI for Multi-Stage Physics Experiments at a Large-Scale User Facility Particle Accelerator" <https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17255>`_ (arXiv:2509.17255), which presents the first deployment of a language-model-driven agentic AI system executing multi-stage physics experiments on a production synchrotron light source.

Production Deployment in High-Stakes Scientific Environments
------------------------------------------------------------

The ALS Accelerator Assistant demonstrates production-grade patterns for deploying agentic AI in scientific facilities. Operating at the `Advanced Light Source <https://als.lbl.gov>`_ at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, this system integrates with EPICS control systems managing 230,000+ process variables (PVs) and serving 40+ beamlines. It demonstrates safe operation in safety-critical environments where beam interruptions can impact dozens of concurrent experiments, providing practical patterns for integrating agentic AI into large-scale scientific facilities.

Particle accelerator facilities like the Advanced Light Source present unique challenges for AI deployment. The operational environment demands both high availability and strict safety constraints:

**Operational Complexity:**

* **Scale**: Over 230,000 PVs across all accelerator subsystems require management
* **Distributed Expertise**: Subsystem knowledge spans accelerator physics, RF systems, magnets, vacuum, diagnostics, and controls
* **Time Pressure**: Troubleshooting unexpected faults lacks predefined solutions, forcing operators to identify relevant channels and assemble analysis under pressure
* **Multi-User Impact**: Any beam interruption typically imposes downtime of at least 30 minutes, immediately affecting dozens of concurrent experiments across 40+ beamlines

**System Response to Operational Challenges:**

To address these demanding operational requirements, the ALS Accelerator Assistant implements a comprehensive suite of specialized capabilities that bridge the gap between natural language requests and executable scientific procedures. Unlike the :doc:`Hello World Tutorial <../getting-started/hello-world-tutorial>` and :doc:`Wind Turbine Example <../getting-started/build-your-first-agent>`, this system demonstrates production-grade patterns:

* **External Service Integration**: Microservices architecture with MongoDB and specialized PV discovery services
* **Complex Data Orchestration**: 7 interconnected capabilities managing real-time and historical scientific data
* **Sophisticated Context Management**: Rich Pydantic models providing LLM-optimized access patterns and human-readable summaries for complex scientific data
* **PV Discovery & Access**: Natural language queries to identify and retrieve accelerator control system addresses, a process that can otherwise demand significant experience, especially where naming conventions are complex or have evolved over time.
* **Historical Data Analysis**: Statistical analysis of beam performance and operational trends
* **Operational Support**: Diagnostic assistance and performance monitoring for accelerator systems

This production deployment demonstrates our proposed architecture for advanced agentic AI systems, validating that they can operate safely and effectively in demanding scientific facilities while maintaining the transparency and reliability required for production use.

   **Broader Applicability Beyond ALS**
   
   The ALS Accelerator Assistant demonstrates architectural patterns and design principles that extend well beyond the Advanced Light Source, providing a blueprint for agentic AI integration across diverse scientific infrastructures.
   
   The majority of the system's codebase is designed for direct deployment across different facilities with minimal modifications. The core framework capabilities, orchestration logic, data analysis workflows, and user interfaces require no facility-specific changes. **The primary adaptation requirement centers on the PV Address Finder subsystem**, which handles the translation between natural language queries and facility-specific control system addresses.

   .. tab-set::

      .. tab-item:: MML-Based Integration
         :sync: mml-integration

         For synchrotron light source facilities, the system's foundation on the `MATLAB Middle Layer (MML) <https://www2.als.lbl.gov/als_physics/csteier/uspas15/lectures/Intro_Matlab_MiddleLayer.pdf>`_ Accelerator Object provides the most direct transferability route for facilities already using MML:
         
         * **Established Infrastructure**: MML is implemented at most synchrotron light sources worldwide, providing a consistent data model
         * **Direct Database Integration**: The normalized PV database structure from MML can be adapted with minimal refinement for the `PV Address Finder`_
         * **Proven Patterns**: The same PV discovery and resolution algorithms apply across different MML-enabled facilities

      .. tab-item:: Non-MML Facilities
         :sync: alternative-strategies

         For facilities without the MATLAB Middle Layer available, several adaptation approaches can provide the required address organization and metadata. While "PV" terminology is EPICS-specific, the underlying address resolution patterns translate directly to other control systems (TANGO, DOOCS, etc.):
         
         * **Consistent Naming Schemes**: Facilities with well-structured control system naming conventions can bypass complex PV discovery through direct semantic matching
         * **Other Middle Layer Frameworks**: The MML-based approach is directly transferable to other accelerator middle layer implementations that provide similar address organization and metadata
         * **Simple Dictionary Approach**: Small control systems with just a few hundred PVs can use a straightforward dictionary mapping each address to descriptive sentences, with a simple search engine (e.g. RAG) built on top for natural language queries
         * **Knowledge Graph-Based Organization**: Large control systems can implement knowledge graphs to organize control system address structures, enabling sophisticated semantic queries and relationship discovery
   
   **Large-Scale Scientific Infrastructure Applications**
   
   The core architectural principles demonstrated here apply to other complex scientific facilities:
   
   * **Multi-Domain Expertise**: Any facility requiring coordination across specialized subsystems
   * **Safety-Critical Operations**: Environments where mistakes have high operational costs
   * **Complex Control Systems**: Facilities with large numbers of controllable parameters and monitoring points
   * **Time-Critical Decision Making**: Operations requiring rapid response to changing conditions

   The Alpha Berkeley Framework's architecture ensures that these patterns can be implemented across diverse scientific domains while maintaining the transparency, safety, and reliability demonstrated at the ALS. In practice, deploying the ALS Assistant to a new facility primarily involves adapting the PV Address Finder's data sources and query resolution logic‚Äîthe vast majority of the system's capabilities, user interfaces, and orchestration components should transfer directly without modification.



From Query to Scientific Insight
--------------------------------

The following example demonstrates a non-routine but practically important machine physics task‚Äîthe type of complex procedure that typically requires custom scripting and deep subsystem knowledge, yet occurs too infrequently for dedicated solutions to exist.

Such procedures present several operational challenges:

* **Custom Scripting Required**: Each experiment is unique, requiring bespoke code combining data retrieval, analysis, and machine control

* **Distributed Expertise**: Operators often need to discuss with domain specialists for advanced procedures, creating bottlenecks

* **Time-Critical Preparation**: Under operational pressure, assembling the necessary scripts, PV addresses, and analysis workflows can take hours

* **Safety Coordination**: Machine interaction requires careful coordination with safety systems and approval workflows

**Operator Request: Insertion Device (ID) Impact Study:**

.. code-block:: text

   "Get the minimum and maximum value of all ID gap values in the last three days. 
   Then write a script which moves each ID from maximum to minimum gap and back 
   while measuring the vertical beam size at beamline 3.1. Sample the gap range 
   with 30 points, wait 5s after each new setpoint for the ID to settle and 
   measure the beam size 5 times at 5Hz. Return a hysteresis plot beam size vs gap."

**Automated Framework Execution:**

1. **Time Range Parsing** ‚Üí Converts "last three days" to precise datetime range

2. **PV Discovery** ‚Üí Resolves "ID gap" and "beam size" to specific EPICS channels via structured PV finder workflow (see detailed process below)

3. **Archive Retrieval** ‚Üí Extracts historical gap ranges for all insertion devices from the ALS EPICS archiver appliance

4. **Data Analysis** ‚Üí Creates Python script to analyze historical ranges and determine optimal measurement parameters

5. **Machine Operation** ‚Üí Executes 30-point bidirectional gap sweep with synchronized measurements using analysis-derived parameters

6. **Data Visualization** ‚Üí Produces professional, annotated hysteresis plots from collected measurement data

   **Automated Physics Experiment Results**: Hysteresis plots showing beam size variations across insertion device gap ranges, demonstrating the framework's ability to orchestrate complex multi-stage physics experiments from natural language instructions.

**Result:** Complete experimental procedure automated from natural language while maintaining operator-standard safety protocols. In this representative case, preparation time was reduced by two orders of magnitude compared to manual scripting, demonstrating the system's ability to bridge the gap between complex user objectives and executable scientific procedures.

System Architecture
-------------------

The ALS Accelerator Assistant demonstrates a production-grade architecture for scientific facility integration:

.. figure:: /_static/resources/als_assistant/fig_ALS_setup.pdf
   :alt: ALS Accelerator Assistant System Architecture
   :align: center
   :width: 90%
   
   **System Architecture**: Multiple users can access the same system simultaneously either remotely or from the control room via web interface (Open WebUI) or command line interface (CLI). The agent orchestrates connections to the PV database, archive data, and execution environments. Model inference uses either local Ollama or cloud providers via `CBorg <https://cborg.lbl.gov>`_ gateway, with EPICS integration ensuring safe hardware interaction.

**Key Architectural Components:**

* **Multi-Interface Access**: Web UI (Open WebUI) and command line for different user preferences
* **Hybrid Inference**: Local GPU (H100) for low-latency + cloud models for advanced reasoning  
* **Service Integration**: PV database, archiver, and Jupyter execution environments
* **Safety Integration**: EPICS-enforced operator-standard constraints for hardware interaction
* **Authentication**: User identity management with personalized context and memory across sessions

PV Address Finder
-----------------

A critical challenge in accelerator control is translating natural language descriptions like "ID gap" or "beam current" into specific EPICS process variable names. The ALS Accelerator Assistant solves this through a structured PV Finder subsystem:

.. figure:: /_static/resources/als_assistant/fig_ALS_PV_finder.pdf
   :alt: PV Address Finder Subsystem Workflow
   :align: center
   :width: 90%
   
   **PV Address Finder Workflow**: Natural language queries are split into atomic intents, preprocessed to extract systems and keywords, then resolved into specific EPICS PVs through a tool-bounded ReAct agent exploring a normalized MATLAB Middle Layer database.

**Technical Implementation:**

* **Data Foundation**: ~10,000 key PVs from normalized MATLAB Middle Layer (MML) export
* **Query Processing**: Atomic intent splitting with system/keyword extraction
* **Bounded Exploration**: ReAct-style agent with strictly limited API access for auditability
* **Transferability**: MML foundation enables adaptation to other synchrotron facilities

This approach provides **auditability** through bounded tool access while **grounding ambiguous terminology** into precise EPICS channel names.

   :class-container: sd-border-0 sd-shadow-sm
   :color: info
   :name: mcp-service-integration

   **What is MCP (Model Context Protocol)?**
   
   `Model Context Protocol <https://modelcontextprotocol.io>`__ is an open standard for connecting Language Models with tool-calling capabilities with external data sources and tools. It enables AI applications like Claude Desktop, VS Code extensions, and other MCP-compatible clients to access specialized services through a standardized interface.

   **PV Finder as Standalone MCP Service**
   
   The ALS Assistant's PV Finder service can be deployed as a standalone MCP server, making the specialized knowledge of ALS control systems available to any MCP-compatible application:

   .. code-block:: python

      # === MCP SERVER WRAPPER ===
      from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
      from applications.als_assistant.services.pv_finder.agent import run_pv_finder_graph

      # Initialize MCP server with service integration
      mcp = FastMCP(
          "[MCP] PV Finder",
          lifespan=app_lifespan,
          host=os.getenv("HOST", "localhost"),
          port=int(os.getenv("PORT", "8051"))
      )

      @mcp.tool()
      async def run_pv_finder(query: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
          """
          Send a query to the PV Finder Agent to handle queries about the ALS control system.
          Use this tool when you need a PV address.
          """
          try:
              # Delegate to framework service layer
              result = await run_pv_finder_graph(user_query=query)
              
              # Normalize for MCP protocol
              if hasattr(result, "model_dump"):
                  return result.model_dump()
              return {"pvs": result.pvs, "description": result.description}
          except Exception as e:
              return {"pvs": [], "description": f"Error: {str(e)}"}

   **Key Benefits:**

   * **Ecosystem Integration**: Use ALS PV knowledge in Claude Desktop, VS Code, and other MCP clients
   * **Service Reusability**: Same service logic serves both framework capabilities and external integrations
   * **Independent Deployment**: MCP server runs separately from main framework application

   **Claude Desktop Integration Example**

   The following figure demonstrates the PV Finder MCP server successfully integrated with Claude Desktop, where a user asks "what's the beam current PV address?" and Claude Desktop correctly responds using the PV Finder tool:

Robust Python Code Execution: From Natural Language to Scientific Scripts
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ALS Accelerator Assistant translates natural language objectives into reliable, executable code through a structured approach that prioritizes robustness over direct translation. Rather than attempting to directly convert user requests into code‚Äîwhich can be brittle and prone to over-design‚Äîthe system employs a three-stage pipeline designed for reliability in production environments:

.. figure:: /_static/resources/als_assistant/fig_ALS_python.pdf
   :alt: Python Execution Pipeline
   :align: center
   :width: 90%
   
   **Python Execution Pipeline**: Natural language tasks are translated into a plan, results schema, and then Python code, which can dynamically access the agent context, is statically analyzed, and may be reviewed by a human operator. Execution is typically confined to containerized Jupyter kernels with strict read/write policies, and every run produces session artifacts (context, notebooks, JSON) for full reproducibility.

**Three-Stage Code Generation Process:**

This decomposition improves reliability by separating concerns and enabling validation at each stage:

1. **High-Level Planning** ‚Üí Strategic plan of script objectives and approach

2. **Schema Generation** ‚Üí Structured JSON schema specifying expected results and data formats

3. **Code Production** ‚Üí Python code generated, conditioned on both plan and schema for consistency

**Safety and Reliability Features:**

* **Containerized Execution**: Isolated Jupyter kernels with strict read/write policies prevent unintended system access

* **Dual Modes**: Read-only (analysis/visualization) vs. write-enabled (machine interaction with mandatory approval)

* **Static Analysis**: Code is analyzed before execution to identify potential issues

* **Human Review**: Operators can inspect generated code before execution, particularly for write operations

* **Full Provenance**: Every run produces structured artifacts (notebooks, JSON, figures) enabling complete reproducibility

* **Approval Workflows**: Write operations require explicit operator approval, maintaining safety standards

* **Modular Architecture**: Specialized capabilities (Data Analysis, Machine Operations, Visualization) share the same execution flow with domain-specific prompts


Framework Patterns Reference

      **Pattern:** Consistent 4-step structure for all capabilities

      .. code-block:: python

         @capability_node(name="capability_name", provides=["OUTPUT"], requires=["INPUT"])
         class ExampleCapability(BaseCapability):
             async def execute(self, state: AgentState) -> AgentState:
                 
                 # Step 1: Extract inputs from current execution step
                 step = StateManager.get_current_step(state)
                 input_data = self._get_required_context(state, "INPUT")
                 
                 # Step 2: Process data (delegate to service layer if complex)
                 result = await self._process_data(input_data)
                 
                 # Step 3: Create framework context object
                 output_context = OutputContext(data=result)
                 
                 # Step 4: Store context and return state updates
                 context_key = step.get("context_key")
                 return StateManager.store_context(
                     state, 
                     registry.context_types.OUTPUT,

                     output_context
                 )

      **Result:** Consistent, testable, and maintainable capability implementation across all framework operations.

   .. tab-item:: Service Layer Separation
      :sync: service-separation

      **Pattern:** Clean separation between framework orchestration and external system complexity

                 # Delegate complex logic to service layer
                 response = await run_pv_finder_graph(user_query=search_query)
                 
                 # Create framework context object
                 pv_finder_context = PVAddresses(
                     pvs=response.pvs,
                     description=response.description,
                 )
                 
                 # Store context using StateManager
                 state_updates = StateManager.store_context(
                     state, 
                     registry.context_types.PV_ADDRESSES, 
                     step.get("context_key"), 
                     pv_finder_context
                 )
                 
                 return state_updates

      **Result:** Independent testing, scaling, and maintenance of business logic vs. framework integration. This architecture also enables individual services to be deployed as standalone MCP servers for broader AI ecosystem integration (see :ref:`PV Finder MCP Service Integration <mcp-service-integration>`).

      **Key Integration Benefits:**

      * **Contextual Task Guidance**: Database records inform task extraction and execution planning
      * **Baseline Comparisons**: Historical data provides reference points for analysis and troubleshooting
      * **Equipment Status Awareness**: Real-time status information guides operational decisions
      * **Extensible Architecture**: Framework's DataSourceProvider interface supports any database backend
